This repository contains selected files from various projects that were either solely or significantly authored by me.

While most of the files are isolated and cannot be run outside the context of their original projects, documentation at the top of each file describes their purpose and functionality.

## Projects Overview
### BVW Round 1: MELT DOWN
The first team assignment of the Building Virtual Worlds (BVW) course in the Entertainment Technology program at Carnegie Mellon University.

MELT DOWN is a single-player game designed for a custom interface built using Microsoft's XBox Adaptive Controller, built in the Unity Engine, where the player's goal is to make sandwiches for increasingly difficult customers. The final playable project can be found [here](https://nelltov.itch.io/melt-down).

Note: This repo is a work in progress; more projects will be added shortly.
